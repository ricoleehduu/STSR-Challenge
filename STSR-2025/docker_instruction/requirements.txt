# requirements.txt

# ===================================================================
# This file should list all Python packages required by your code
# that are NOT already included in the base Docker image.
# The base image (pytorch/pytorch:1.12.1-cuda11.3-cudnn8-devel) already includes:
# - torch, torchvision, torchaudio
# - numpy
# - and many other common packages.
#
# You can check the pre-installed packages by running the base image interactively:
# docker run -it --rm pytorch/pytorch:1.12.1-cuda11.3-cudnn8-devel pip list
# ===================================================================

# Please add your specific dependencies here.
# For medical imaging, you might need:
simpleitk
scikit-image
monai

# It's a good practice to pin versions for reproducibility, e.g.:
# monai==1.3.0
# simpleitk==2.3.1
